"""Score a free-text reply against a benchmark answer. Works for any agent: only the reply text is used.

Every benchmark question asks the agent to finish with a line "Answer: ...", and only that committed
answer is scored, so hedging ("it's one of these six", "between 92 and 108 m") doesn't earn credit.
A reply without an "Answer:" line scores as wrong.

- space answers: the expected room (its unique ref or name) must be in the answer, and come before any
  runner-up room.
- number answers: the answer must hold exactly one number, within tolerance.
- largest_room also needs the area: some number in the answer must match it."""
